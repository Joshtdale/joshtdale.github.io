                <p>Pseudocode is a version of code that is not specific to any programing language. It is a way of planning out
                    code logically before any code is written.

                        The art of coding can be very complex. Solving problems with code is not always easy and can 
                        involve many step that are heavily dependent on a sequential order. Pseudocoding before any code is
                    written forces you to think about your code logically. When you are done, you should have a sort of road map that 
                    is easy to read an process as opposed to staring at a wall of code while trying to remember what each line does.<br></br>

                    Pseudocoding is definitely one of my weaknesses, I have trouble forgetting about specific programming languages. 
                    When ever I do spend extra time pseudocoding, it heavily reduces the time it take for me to build my projects. 
                    It takes out most of the headaches that come with writing code that is logic driven.
