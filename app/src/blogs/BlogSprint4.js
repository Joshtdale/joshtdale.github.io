                <h1>Intro to ReactJS</h1>
                <p>This week was our first week with React. It was a rocky start, at first it seemed like we spent all this time learning JavaScript 
                    only to be confused by how similar yet different React is. Early on in the week, it all just magically clicked for me. 
                This led to me being able to make large strides this week in terms of React concepts and being able to add stretch goals to my project.</p>

                        <p>I feel like this was possibly my best week of the bootcamp. For some reason React just clicked
                            for me earlier in the week so I was able to spend more time
                            putting things into practice as opposed to struggling with the basics of React.</p>

                        <h5>What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?</h5>
                        <p>There aren't any frameworks off the top of my head that I know enough about to think that they
                            are something that I would want
                            to learn. However, I'm really enjoying React so far and I'm excited to learn more of it's
                            capabilities.</p>

                            final project.</h5>
                            <p>I think local storage seems to be an extremely useful tool that can enhance the user experience</p>
