                        <h5>What have you learned about CLIs? Do you think they are scary?</h5>
                        <p>CLIs can be a big help in helping the user get around within an operating system. If you know your
                            way around a CLI, you can quickly input commands, parameters, and call functions to accomplish tasks
                            much quicker than trying to fumble around the interface of your os (operating system). I so far have a 
                            very limited understanding of CLIs and pretty much only know how to use it for commits, pushes, and 
                            branch creation. In the future I would like to spend more time learning how to become a CLI wizard 
                            but at the moment it seems like a whole other language to me.

                        <h5>If you were to build a CLI, what would it do?</h5>
                        <p>Since I'm basically a baby when it comes to my CLI knowledge and vocabulary, I don't know that I'm in any real
                            position to answer this question. Maybe I would make things dumbed down a bit so that some of the commands 
                            are a little more intuitive. Although I'm sure the creators of each different CLI and people with a lot of 
                            experience think that it is super intuitive.
                        </p>

                        <h5>List some ideas that without a Framework, would take you a long time to code</h5>
                            <p>Frameworks add a level of abstraction to your code so that there are less meticulous things for 
                                you to worry about. They simplify many things that would other wise be complicated. For instance, React 
                                gives you the ability to build elements and reuse them. This saves a ton of time when you are building
                                webpages because you only have to build things like a navbar once for example.
                            </p>
