                        <h5>Now that you are halfway through bootcamp, what has been the biggest hurdle 
                          that you have gone past? What do you think is going to be the next biggest thing 
                          to power through?</h5>
                        <p>
                          The toughest thing I've had to deal with so far is time management. I definitely haven't gotten 
                          past it yet either. I'm really enjoying this journey of learning how to program but it's been 
                          really hard trying to find a work life balance. I have a pregnant wife at home and we both are 
                          so busy during the week so I really try to keep the amount of work that I do outside of class 
                          down to a minimum. I struggle with the thought that I might be doing myself a disservice 
                          and that I should put more work in outside of class, especially when I see and hear about 
                          how much extra work some of my other classmates are putting in. Although so far I don't feel like 
                          I have put myself in a bad spot. Somehow I think I'm managing to keep up with the class and I don't 
                          feel like my work is coming out less than average. I'm telling myself that as soon as my projects start 
                          to suffer is when I'll kick it into overdrive outside of class time. So far nothing has been a bigger 
                          hurdle than this and I don't see anything else being harder than it.

                        <h5>Compared to earlier, what are three ideas you might want to do for your final project? 
                          Are they the same ideas as before, or have they changed now that you understand more 
                          about the technology and your limitations?</h5>

                            <p>From the start of the bootcamp I had the idea to make a website for my friend's coffee 
                              cart business. I think it would be a good project for me since I think the strongest projects 
                              I've had so far have been front-end forward. The website would need to have a form for business 
                              inquiries and I could add e-commerce to the site. I think this would have a good amount of back-end 
                              so that way I can show my back-end abilities as well as my skills with front-end design.
                            </p>
                          <li>Discord/messaging app clone</li>
                            <p>I don't have many ideas for this yet as I have been really focused form the start on implementing my 
                              first idea as my final project. I think a messaging app could be a fun build as I could put a creative 
                              spin on it possibly. However it does scare me as I have no idea even where to start with it. I foresee 
                              myself wasting a lot of time on the front-end.
