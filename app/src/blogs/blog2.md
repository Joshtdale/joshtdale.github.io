#### **End of Week one**

---

Week one of bootcamp was definitely more challenging than expected. The course work took me a little longer to complete than I would have hoped but I turned everything in on time. I feel good about what I turned in even though I would have liked to have worked on it a little more before demo day. Hopefully week two will be easier now that I know what to expect. I plan really hack away at the tasks earlier in the upcoming week than the previous week. This hopefully will allow me more time to work on the project before demo day.
