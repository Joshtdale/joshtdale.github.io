#### End of week 3
---

This week requred a HEAVY  amount of reading. Some how I managed to power through and finish it up on Wednesday. This gave me more time to work on my project than usual so I decided to take the project one step further than the requirements. For the original project, we had to create a "[Silly story generator](https://joshtdale.github.io/silly-story-generator/)." I took this format, added some styling and a little extra JavaScript to turn the story generator into a horror themed [madlib creator](https://joshtdale.github.io/silly-story-generator/sandbox/sandbox.html). It wasn't much extra work but the process helped me gain a greater understanding of the inner workings of the prewritten code.

- **What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?**

To me, I feel like I picked up on HTML and CSS pretty quick. Both are fairly intuitive. JavaScript is a whole other story. I wouldn't say I'm struggling with it. I am more overwhelmed than anything. The logic makes sense to me. However, what seems to be getting me is the many different ways of solving problems. I end up code that is a combination of solutions from different documents that don't work well together.

- **What are some objects that your blog incorporates?**

Currently I've used images and hyperlinks. I would like to incorporate new things to give some extra personality to my blog. The main reason I haven't done this yet is time constraints. Hopefully in the next few weeks I can come up with some ideas on how to make this blog more me.

- **What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?**

Pseudocoding seems to be my weekness from this past week. I'm aware of the importance of pseudocoding as a skill. I definitely need to put some extra work in so I can get better.
