### **Josh Dale's Blog**

This is my first blog post of many documenting my journey through the process of becoming a web developer.

#### First week of Coding Bootcamp

### -**Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?**

This first week has been pretty brutal. I'm still tring to figure out how to best juggle class and working a full time job

### -**What are you excited or eager to learn more about?**

I can't wait to get more experience with the tools we are using in this course so that I can feel a little more comfortable with the course work.


### -**What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?**

I love building things and seeing results. I've always been a tinkerer. When I was a kid, I would take apart all my toy and try to put them back together. In middle school, I taught myself to solder and rewire my guitars. This skill proved useful in college when I quickly became the guy everyone went to for electric instrument repairs and modifications.


### **Code**

This is my simple styling for this blog post.
