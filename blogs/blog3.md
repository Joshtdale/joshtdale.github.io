#### **End of Week Two**

---

### -**What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?**

This week for our project we had to use html tags to link CSS rules to a page. This project was particularly easy for me as I had already encountered in in the [Intro to Web Development](https://www.awesomeinc.org/intro-to-web-development?gclid=Cj0KCQjwmdGYBhDRARIsABmSEeOkCoUpMZhunP5uhKx-XHVQNP7eT412wal2SYOqT5oNilhdRZ4BrsIaAg09EALw_wcB) course. My previous experience with this project led me to finish early in the week. I decided to use the extra time to add some Javascript to the page since I am a little less comfortable with it. In the Intro class we learned how to use Java to change CSS rules on a page. Since I already knew generally what to do, I figured it would be good practice. After hours and hours of work with some small successes, This is what I came up with [My partial sucess](https://joshtdale.github.io/Structuring-a-page-of-content/). It is not exactly what I wanted. I was trying to change the background color of all of the green elements on the page with one button on the far right of the nav bar. I can tell that I'm close but I am not sure where to go from here. I will most likely try to find the solution and update it bellow.

### -**What are you struggling with?**

Finding the time and energy to power through onbording has been difficult since I'm still working full time. I have to get up at 5am for work and by the time I get home all I want to do is sleep.

### -**How do you solve a problem?** 

Usually the first thing I do is go to google so that I can learn from other people's experiences and or find the solution.

### -**What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?**

Taking a break from what I'm working on usually clears my head and helps me to move forward. The only problem with that is, I'm the kind of person that would rather power through than take a break.
