#### End of week 3

- What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?

To me, I feel like I picked up on HTML and CSS pretty quick. Both are fairly intuitive. JavaScript is a whole other story. I wouldn't say I'm struggling with it. I am more overwhelmed than anything. The logic makes sense to me. However, what seems to be getting me is the many different ways of solving problems. I end up code that is a combination of solutions from different documents that don't work well together.

- What are some objects that your blog incorporates?

Currently I've used images and hyperlinks. I would like to incorporate new things to give some extra personality to my blog. The main reason I haven't done this yet is time constraints. Hopefully in the next few weeks I can come up with some ideas on how to make this blog more me.

- What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?

Pseudocoding seems to be my weekness from this past week. I'm aware of the importance of pseudocoding as a skill. I definitely need to put some extra work in so I can get better.
