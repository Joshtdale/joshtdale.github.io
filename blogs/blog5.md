### **Weekly reflection**
        This week was pretty rough. We were given the biggest work load that weâ€™ve ever had which led to a very intense week. I really struggled to get things done, I ended up having to decide mid week what projects needed to take priority. I ended up completing everything and I only had to turn in a couple things late. I definitely would have liked more time to work on the projects so that I could understand them more.

### **Final project**
        For our final project we had to create an alarm clock on our own. Up until now, all our projects were "hand holding" meaning that we were given step my step Instructions and some already existing code. For that alarm clock all we were given was a prompt and certain guidelines to folow.
        I was very intimidated going into the project as we had a lot of material to work through at the beginning of the week. Once I started on the project, I had quite a few early successes. I started with the clock portion of the project which ended up being easier than expected. There were very few times that I ran into blockers that lasted more than five minutes. This gave me some much needed confidence going into the alarm potion of the project. My confidence was soon destroyed as I ended up running into problem after problem after problem. I eventually somehow got to a point where I believed I had a working alarm clock. It worked for me when I initially built it but on demo day, I decided to show it off to a friend. Of course my code was broken and I spent an hour fixing it. I ended up having quite a few bugs in the 12 to 24 hour conversion part of my code. I believe that they have all been fixed, I will probably revisit the project and double check it in the near future. For now, the project is done to the point where I'm happy with it but it could definitely be improved.

- **What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?**
I think it made working full time easier than it would have been if we weren't remote. Having the first four weeks be remote makes taking the course a little more realistic for me. I'm sure others would feel the same way.
- **What hindered your progress during Onboarding?**<br>
Working full time definitely made the course load almost seem impossible to complete at times. It really left me with not much time durring the week. Even though it was tough to fit everything in, I'm greatful to still have the availability to work. It would be a lot harder to justify taking this course if I had to be jobless for 16 weeks as opposed to 12.
- **How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?**
I forced my self to power through the work load, just like I did in college. My wife and I are expecting our first kid in December so that gave me much needed motivation.
