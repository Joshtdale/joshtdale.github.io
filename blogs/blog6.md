### **Weekly reflection**<br>
#### I feel like this week was more work than I ever had to do in college. Even though I was exhausted throughout the week, This has been the most excited I have ever been to learn and progress.

- **What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?** <br>
This week I did the most pseudocoding I ever have, leading my build for the project to go extremly smooth. There weren't many unexpected things during the project that held me back. Since the bulk of the project was JavaScript logic, I went into the build knowing exactly what to do. The only thing that slowed me down was getting sidetracked with styling.

- **What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?** <br>
I'd be interested in learning more about event listeners and how to use them more efficiently. I had planned to add an event listener to the back button of the browser so that it would manipulate my JavaScript. Hopefully sometime in the near future I can revisit the project and add the features I didn't have time to add.
- **How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?** <br>
It's been really nice to be able to talk to other people sharing my experience. I've found I get stuck on problems less cause it's easier to ask for help when everyone is in the same room.
- **What is your “Why”?** <br>
My wife and I are expecting our first kid in December. Working in a field with little more financial stability would be helpful in this major life transition we'll be going through. I have worked in the service industry ever since I was 14 years old. Doing that for so long was extremely mentally taxing. I'm hoping that web development will be a good fresh start for me.
